{"name":"AD-X","tagline":"Active Directory library for php","body":"# AD-X :: Active Directory library for php\r\n\r\nThe **AD-X** library aims to provide an easy-to-use, object-oriented and powerful tool to work with Active Directory and related components, like Exchange.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### The important ones\r\n----\r\n - An understandable, object-oriented API to work with Active Directory\r\n - **Automatic data conversion** - with this library, you won't encounter a value that has to be converted to something else before you can work with it in php ( like `unicodePwd` or `lastLogonTimestamp` ) - you simply use the values and the library will take care of the conversion\r\n - [User management](http://alaneor.github.io/AD-X/api/class-ADX.Classes.User.html) / **Microsoft Exchange mailbox management** ( yes, you can create Exchange mailboxes / mail users with this! )\r\n - Support for paged searches\r\n - Support for referrals - useful if you operate on multiple domains in a forest\r\n - TLS or SSL encryption support\r\n - Directory Schema caching allows to perform checks, validations and provide guidance before you even attempt to modify anything on the server\r\n - Simple [change tracking](http://alaneor.github.io/AD-X/api/class-ADX.Core.Task.html#_changes) on your directory server\r\n - [Selectors](http://alaneor.github.io/AD-X/api/class-ADX.Util.Selector.html) - a simple and elegant way to retrieve objects\r\n\r\n### The nice to have ones\r\n----\r\n - *ldap v3* protocol support\r\n - Namespaced classes to prevent collisions\r\n - Exceptions-based error handling\r\n - Autoloading support via Composer\r\n - Object-to-json conversion for easy integration with your front-end\r\n - Optional simple ldap query builder\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n - PHP 5.4.0 and newer with LDAP support ( [setup instructions](http://www.php.net/manual/en/ldap.installation.php) )\r\n - OpenSSL module for SSL / TLS connections ( [setup instructions](http://cz1.php.net/manual/en/openssl.installation.php) )\r\n\r\n### Install:\r\n\r\n#### Via Composer:\r\n\r\nThis will install the latest stable release:<br>\r\n`composer require alaneor/ad-x:dev-master`\r\n( visit [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/alaneor/ad-x) for list of all available versions )\r\n\r\n### Post-installation ( optional, but **strongly recommended** ) :\r\n\r\n#### Generate the schema cache:\r\n\r\nCreate a new php script with the following contents, providing relevant information like domain and your domain credentials:\r\n```php\r\n    include './vendor/autoload.php'; // Include Composer's autoloader\r\n\r\n    $link = new ADX\\Core\\Link( 'company.com', 389 ); // Connect to server on default port\r\n    $link->bind( 'username@company.com', 'password' ); // Authenticate to the server\r\n    ADX\\Core\\Schema::build( $link ); // Build the local schema cache ( takes some time, go get a coffee )\r\n```\r\nA future release will include a wizard-like script to guide you through the process right after installation.\r\n\r\nDepending on the stability of your Active Directory environment, you might need to re-build the schema cache occasionally, especially after upgrading to a newer Active Directory functional level or after installing new directory-related components, like MS Exchange, OCS Services or similar.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation is currently available for the API only, but it includes a lot of examples and explanations.\r\nI recommend that you read the documentation in the following order:\r\n\r\n - [Link](http://alaneor.github.io/AD-X/api/class-ADX.Core.Link.html) : How to connect to the directory and perform authentication\r\n - [Task](http://alaneor.github.io/AD-X/api/class-ADX.Core.Task.html) : How to search the directory and retrieve data\r\n - [Object](http://alaneor.github.io/AD-X/api/class-ADX.Core.Object.html) : How to work with retrieved objects and read/manipulate its attributes\r\n - [Attribute](http://alaneor.github.io/AD-X/api/class-ADX.Core.Attribute.html) : How to manipulate individual attributes and read/manipulate its values\r\n - [User](http://alaneor.github.io/AD-X/api/class-ADX.Classes.User.html) : How to work with users and manage Exchange mailboxes / mail users\r\n\r\n### Read online: [API documentation](http://alaneor.github.io/AD-X/api)\r\n### Generate the documentation locally:\r\n\r\n1. Download the library\r\n1. Install the dependencies using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):\r\n```\r\ncomposer install --dev\r\n```\r\n1. Generate the API documentation using [ApiGen](http://apigen.org/) ( installed by Composer ):\r\n```\r\nphp ./vendor/bin/apigen.php\r\n```\r\n1. Generated documentation will be available at *./docs/www/index.html*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known limitations\r\n\r\n - The *ldap v2* protocol is not supported and never will be. Pull requests to provide backwards-compatibility will be refused.\r\n - The library has been built **specifically for Active Directory**. Compatibility with standards-based ldap servers like [OpenLDAP](http://openldap.org) is likely broken. I have no plans to address this at the moment but a future release might make such thing possible.\r\n - Unit tests are missing completely. I realise this might be a serious issue for future development and plan to address this with a future update. Any help with writing tests is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n## Future to-dos\r\n\r\n - Improve the API documentation\r\n - Provide \"helper\" classes to simplify working with computers, groups, contacts etc.\r\n - Write unit tests\r\n - Write tutorials\r\n\r\n## Found an issue / have idea?\r\n\r\nPlease submit issues and ideas to the Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Alaneor/AD-X/issues).\r\n\r\nContributing rules will be provided in a future update - for now, please try to match the programming style currently used in the code when submitting pull requests.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis software is licensed under the **BSD (3-Clause) License**.\r\nSee the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more information.\r\n\r\n## Appreciate\r\n\r\nIf you like this project and enjoy using it, feel free to spread the word about it wherever you wish.\r\n\r\nYou may also consider donating.\r\n\r\n### Via Flattr:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://flattr.com/thing/1301881/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png\" alt=\"Flattr this\" title=\"Flattr this\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
